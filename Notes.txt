Selector in css:
A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.

Element Selector
Id Selector
Class Selector
Group Selector
Universal Selector:
Pseudo-Class Selector
Pseudo-Element Selector

id and class selector:
===============
When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript.

Pseudo-Class Selector:Pseudo-classes are keywords that start with a colon. For example, :hover is a pseudo-class.
	ex:a:hover{}

Pseudo-Element Selector: Pseudo-elements start with a double colon ::. ::before is an example of a pseudo-element.
	ex:
<p class="box">Content in the box in my HTML page.</p>

.box::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

=>The use of the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements along with the content property is referred to as "Generated Content" in CSS
